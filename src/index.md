## What will this workshop cover

Many people use async Rust, but my feeling is that a lot of people don't understand it.
I think that's a shame. I hope to give you the seed of an idea that will kick start some of you
to investigate these systems further.

My the end of the session today, we should have some key components of an async Rust system built.
They won't be efficient or suitable for production use, but I reckon it's a good basis to start with.
